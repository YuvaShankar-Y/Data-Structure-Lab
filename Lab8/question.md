A. Utilize C++ STL to solve the following (K5),
There are no block towers, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th tower consists of dy blocks.
In one move, you can move one block from tower ii to tower j, but only if ag > ay. That move increases ay by 1 and decreases dy by 1.
You can perform as many moves ass you would like (possibly zero).
What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower 1 after the moves?
Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1 S t S 104)- the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 - 10")- the number of towers.
The second line contains na integers dgsdgs .an , d (1 ≤ a, ≤ 10°)- the number of blocks on each tower.
The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 - 105.
Output
For each testcase, print the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower 1 after you make any number of moves (possibly, zero).

B. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Tree ADT using a character
binary tree. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The
Tree ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert
2. Preorder
3. Inorder
4. Postorder
5. Search
6. Exit

What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)
