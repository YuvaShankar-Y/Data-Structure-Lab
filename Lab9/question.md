A. Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k. In this game, initially, n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:

Nene finds the a_1-th, a_2-th, ..., a_k-th players in the row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i-th player in the row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in the row, they are skipped.

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a = [3, 5] and n = 5 players. Let the players be named player A, player B, ..., player E in the order they are lined up initially.

Then, before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE.
Nene finds the 3rd and the 5th players in the row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round.
Now players are lined up as ABD.
Nene finds the 3rd and the 5th players in the row. The 3rd player is player D and there is no 5th player in the row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round.
Now players are lined up as AB.
In the third round, Nene finds the 3rd and 5th players. There are none. No one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round.
Players A and B are declared as the winners.

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene gave you q integers n_1, n_2, ..., n_q and you should answer the following question for each 1 <= i <= q independently: "How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially?"

Input:

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 250). The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers k and q (1 <= k, q <= 100) \u2014 the length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100) \u2014 the sequence a.

The third line contains q integers n_1, n_2, ..., n_q (1 <= n_i <= 100).

Output:

For each test case, output q integers: the i-th (1 <= i <= q) of them should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players join the game.







B.There are n participants in a competition, participant i having a strength of s_i.

Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the next strongest participant (excluding themselves). In other words, each participant i wants to know the difference between their strength s_i and the maximum strength s_j among all other participants (j != i). Note that this difference can be negative.

So, they ask you for your help! For each i (from 1 to n), calculate and output the difference s_i - max(s_j for j != i).

Input:

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) \u2014 the number of participants (length of the array).

The following line contains n space-separated positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_n (1 <= s_i <= 10^9) \u2014 the strengths of the participants.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Output:

For each test case, output n space-separated integers. For each i (1 <= i <= n), output the difference between s_i and the maximum strength of any other participant.



C. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Tree ADT using a binary search tree. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Tree ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert
2. Preorder
3. Inorder
4. Postorder
5. Search
6. Exit



D. Add a "construct expression tree" method to the binary tree data structure from the previous lab codeâ€”import stack from the standard template library (STL) to construct the expression tree. Import the Tree ADT program into another program that gets a valid postfix expression, constructs, and prints the expression tree. It consists of the following operations.

1. Postfix Expression
2. Construct Expression Tree
3. Preorder
4. Inorder
5. Postorder
6. Exit
